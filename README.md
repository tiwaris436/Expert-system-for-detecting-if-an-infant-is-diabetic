# Expert-system-for-detecting-if-an-infant-is-diabetic

In this example, we're interested in children diabetes. We will built expert system which will analyze whether children is diabetic or not using some of the variables like high/low blood sugar signs, glycemic index and if the parents has diabetes.


We have some results from expert for detecting diabetes in infants. So, we will use that results to build our expert system. We have some of the variables which we will use to build Expert System. “glycemie, shakiness, hunger, sweating, headach, diabetic_parents, pale, urination, thirst, blurred_vision, dry_mouth, smelling_breath, shortness_of_breath”. If glycemie > 10 then there is risk of high blood sugar and if glycemie < 4 then there is risk of low blood sugar. If shakiness, hunger, sweating, headach, pale, diabetic_parents all these variables take True value then child could be diabetic. If If shakiness, hunger, sweating, headach are True and glycemie <4 then there is high risk of diabetes. If diabetic_parents, urination, thirst, blurred_vision, dry_mouth, smelling_breath, shortness_of_breath all these variables take True value then child could be diabetic. If glycemie>10 and urination, thirst, blurred_vision, dry_mouth, smelling_breath, shortness_of_breath all these variables take True value then then there is high risk of diabetes. We will use all these results to build our Expert system for detecting children diabetes.
